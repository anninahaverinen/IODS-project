title: Rstudio Exercise1

This introductory exercise involved getting familiar with R and  
GitHub. The first task was to download R and RStudio to your own  
computer and do the coding excercises on R in DataCamp. I have  
never, ever done anything like this before, and frankly I consider
myself quite bad with computers, but I do really find this  quite exciting. 
The next task was to install and get familiar with GitHub. 
I'm not quite sure I understand what GitHub is, but I'm sure I will 
know during this course. Last up was to work with RMarkdown
files in Rstudio to get the course diary initiated.
